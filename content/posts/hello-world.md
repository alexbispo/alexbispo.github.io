# Hello World

Welcome to my new personal blog! This blog is built with:

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Markdown**

## Why Static?

Static sites are fast, secure, and easy to host. This blog is designed to be deployed to **GitHub Pages**.

## Code Example

Here is a simple code snippet:

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
